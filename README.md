## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- SCSS / SASS

### What I learned

The best new thing I learned during this project was the overlay effect using mix-blend-mode.

### Continued development

There is definitely an unnecessary mix of grid and flexbox in my solution. For example, I have switched between the two at different viewport widths.
I have started revisiting CSS Grid and soon will review flexbox again. Then I will come back and tidy up this mess!

### Useful resources

- [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/mix-blend-mode](https://www.example.com) - This helped me with the mix-blend-mode, which added a purple 'overlay' to the image.
